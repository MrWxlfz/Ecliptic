**Issued by:** Ecliptic Labs  
**Applies to:** All software, services, systems, scripts, dashboards, APIs, and associated intellectual property developed, hosted, or distributed by Ecliptic Labs.

## 1. Ownership and Intellectual Property

All materials provided by Ecliptic Labs — including but not limited to source code, APIs, backend services, documentation, detection logic, obfuscation systems, infrastructure, and design — are the exclusive intellectual property of Ecliptic Labs unless explicitly stated otherwise.

All rights are reserved.

You may not:
- Reproduce, fork, reverse engineer, sublicense, repurpose, or commercialize this software or its derivatives
- Create competing services or projects based on the structure, naming, architecture, or functionality of this system
- Use our branding, naming, or internal structure to imply affiliation or ownership

Unauthorized replication or imitation of our systems, UI, logic, or backend structure is strictly prohibited and subject to legal enforcement.

---

## 2. Access Restrictions and Authorized Use

Ecliptic Labs operates under a **closed-access model**. No part of this platform is publicly available for review, integration, or testing unless otherwise and explicitly approved.

You are only permitted to:
- Access services via a formal license or partnership agreement
- Interact with Ecliptic systems as an approved client, enterprise partner, or registered Security Tester (by invitation only)
- Submit contributions through secured, authorized pathways

You are not permitted to:
- View, clone, fork, or interact with this repository unless explicitly authorized
- Use this software or related services in any live, test, or commercial environment
- Use this software to enhance, train, or power external services or moderation tools

Unauthorized access to any part of our ecosystem — including repos, endpoints, web portals, or internal APIs — constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

---

## 3. API Access and Infrastructure Protections

All APIs, authentication systems, and internal services are protected by active enforcement and rate control. Any access or use must be pre-approved and adhere to defined scopes and environments.

You are strictly prohibited from:
- Using unauthorized API tokens, endpoints, or payloads
- Probing or logging request/response cycles to reverse engineer functionality
- Simulating or spoofing traffic to mimic Ecliptic behavior
- Attempting to reimplement, clone, or “sandbox” Ecliptic features outside approved environments

Usage is monitored. Violations will be pursued.

---

## 4. Contribution Terms and Approvals

Ecliptic Labs does not operate an open-source contribution model.

Contributions are accepted **by invitation only** and must meet the following criteria:
- The contributor is pre-approved and under agreement (CLA and/or NDA)
- Submissions are original and free of third-party licensing constraints
- Work is submitted securely and privately for internal review
- Ecliptic Labs maintains full ownership rights of any accepted contributions

Public forks, unsolicited pull requests, or unapproved issues will be closed or removed. Misuse of the contribution system may result in blacklisting.

---

## 5. Security Testing and Vulnerability Disclosure

Ecliptic Labs maintains a structured, internal vulnerability program. Security researchers or developers may only submit vulnerability reports under the following conditions:

- You must be registered in the Security Testing Program (not publicly open at this time)
- All reports must be submitted privately to **security@eclipticlabs.xyz**
- Public disclosure of flaws without coordination is a violation of this Agreement
- You may not test, probe, or simulate attacks in production or unauthorized environments

Responsible reports may be eligible for recognition or rewards at the discretion of Ecliptic Labs. Exploiting or leaking discovered vulnerabilities may result in enforcement actions.

All usage is subject to oversight. Systems may include embedded fingerprinting, call trace validation, and anti-replication markers.
